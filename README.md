Geolocation App
==================================

Geolocation app is a demo app that tracks and guides people on indoor itinirary using Li-Fi lamps and cameras implemented with AI tracking algorithms.

This app demonstrated the use of [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make REST requests to the web service, [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) to
handle the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects, and [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) to retrieved the data from the lamps and cameras by URI.
